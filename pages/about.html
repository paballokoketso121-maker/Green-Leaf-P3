      <h2>📖 Our Story</h2>

        Founded in 2015 in Johannesburg, Greenleaf Organic began as a small family-run business 
        selling fresh produce at local farmers’ markets. Over the years, we have grown into a trusted 
        supplier of organic products, expanding our range to include vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy, 
        and healthy snacks.
